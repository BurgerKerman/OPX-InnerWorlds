		#LOC_OPX-IW_Quazen_Desc = Quazen, Quazen, Quazen, an oblong asteroid named for the Kerbal god of duality. It's full of mysteries, like its high inclination, its backwards spin, or its strange color. Perhaps it's one of those cheese puffs that got all over the discovery image plates. The asteroid has been proposed as part of an "asteroid belt grand tour" mission occasionally, but how that may happen is still controversial.

		#LOC_OPX-IW_Krov_Desc = Krov is the first of Quazen's discovered moons. While rather dark, it still reflects a decent enough amount of light to be detected by a powerful-enough telescope. Light curve analysis has revealed a slightly spiky moon, but how well it can handle it still remains to be seen.

		#LOC_OPX-IW_Selbig_Desc = The third largest asteroid in the inner solar system. Selbig is a major asteroid in the outer parts of the asteroid belt. It is very close to spherical, likely because it reaccreted after the creation of the large Selbig family of asteroids, and is the largest carbonaceous asteroid.

		#LOC_OPX-IW_Hafnia_Desc = Hafnia is a medium-sized rock with a storied history. Seemingly one of the brightest asteroids known, it was a surprise to have been discovered so relatively late in the asteroid discovery period--especially with such a long 50-year gap between it and the last numbered asteroid. Perhaps us Kerbals got more focused on more pertinent matters. Like bowling.

		#LOC_OPX-IW_Kortens_Desc = 45 Kortens looks to all the world like a fairly standard, if rather large, asteroid. However, it was recently discovered to be the only known asteroid to possess more than one moon. Its surface is cracked and pockmarked with craters, which likely preserve some of the oldest terrain in the solar system.

Discovered only a few years before the beginning of the space age by Bree Kerman at the Crater Peak observatory, it was later determined to be broadly similar to the later discovered near-Kerbin asteroid 433 Edas in shape and composition. Unlike Edas however, Loushine is believed to have a lunar companion.

		#LOC_OPX-IW_Kret_Desc = 3820 Kret is a "quasi-satellite," an object that follows a pseudo-orbit around Kerbin. For this reason it was once classified as a third moon of Kerbin. It has an unusual peanut-like shape.

		#LOC_OPX-IW_Doppler_Name_Alt = 99942 Doppler^N
		#LOC_OPX-IW_Doppler_Desc = Doppler is the most massive near-Kerbin object by far, and due to its incredibly close orbit, it has been considered Kerbin's third moon. Astronomers first noticed it when trying to brush off dust from photographic plates, leading to the nickname of "Dustin" (to the chagrin of its discoverer, Dustin Kerman). However it ended up, it may have approached somewhat close to Kerbin not long ago.

		#LOC_OPX-IW_Dyva_Desc = Dyva is Doppler's little moon. It's understood so little other than that it is little; so little that a jump off of it can cause a little change in its orbit.

		// Research Bodies
		#LOC_OPX-IW_RB_Doppler = This body oddly looked a lot like a teeny-tiny Duna. How it got there, we have no idea; we thought this was dust. Let's just call it Doppler, because it sounds nice.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_RB_Dyva = Wait... there's a moon here?! How the heck did that ever happen around such a small body? Oh well, might as well call it Dyva; it sure did deviate from our expectations.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_RB_Quazen = This asteroid's oddly high up in the sky... and it almost seems like there's two things, when you analyze the light. Maybe we should see about reviving the long-forgotten god of Quazen.
		
		// Tarsier Tech
		#LOC_OPX-IW_TT_Doppler = It looks like a chunk of Duna blown off from an impact.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_TT_Quazen = The reflectors might be off... or it's actually a two-toned asteroid.
		
		// Surface Sample
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Sample_B = The surface of this lobe seems to have pockets of sapphire out of the rest of the beryllium. This sapphire must have been dredged up due to geological activity of some sort.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Sample_M = These mountains seem to have much looser rock than the rest of Turq's Lobe; it's essentially a snowy dirtball.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Sample_S = The rock gets thinner--and slipperier--as you ascend the mountain range.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Sample_L = The surface here is covered with sapphires. You pick up the purest one you can find, then realize that you cannot call your jeweler to make a ring. You guess the spouse will have to wait...
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Sample_G = The surface here seems flaky, like it's covered in powdered sulfur. You think of the smell it will bring about when you return to the ship, and then wonder if the sample came from Pol as well.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Sample_D = There seems to be a bit of sulfur here, but it also is mixied with phosphorus of some kind. There is tons of rock beneath the dusty surface, however.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Sample_C = The rock here seems to be heavily compressed from the violent impact, but it is oddly lacking in the dust that spread to the rest of the hemisphere.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Sample_I = Tidal stresses... make this... terrible... to dig into!
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Sample_NP = Whatever body impacted this region had to have left some sort of tholin deposits. But how they survived a body that came from so far away remains to be seen.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Sample_SP = Some slightly harder rock here, but some that doesn't need phenomonal strength to even make budge.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Sample_C = This doesn't seem like rust... more like tholins, which can only form out near the region of, say, Mracksis...
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Sample_M = Somewhat of a mix of rust and tholins. Kinda hard to chip through.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Sample_E = This seems to be made of ice, mixed with some silver and other metals for good measure.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Sample_MaL = It's very crumbly. Just like a butter cookie.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Sample_MiL = It's very crumbly. Just like a butter cookie.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Sample_CoP = This is kind of dense, but not much denser than the lobes. Almost rough and fleshy.
		
		// Crew Report
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_SpaceH = The body is quite the double-headed jewel. Visiting here is going to be very, very interesting...
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_SpaceL = You see glints from minerals speckled across Turq's Lobe, especially within Lago Stravinsky.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_Landed = Wow. What a ride here.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_B = It's blue and white all over. You're suddenly green... well, greener... with envy.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_M = From this vantage point, both lobes of Quazen are visible. The contrast is incredible!
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_S = The peaks are so white from here...
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_L = There is water at the bottom of the ocean; there is sapphire at the bottom of the lake. How?!
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_G = The rocket engines must have kicked up some dust from the surface; it's floating all around you.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_D = The rocket engines must have kicked up some dust from the surface; it's floating all around you.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_C = Here you see one of the deepest craters ever seen. How Quazen didn't fall apart after this is a mystery for the ages.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_I = Between the blue and the gold... is just a plain field of gray.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_NP = A red north pole, huh? It feels like Festivus has returned.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Crew_SP = We don't really know what went on here, but the craters seemed to be shaped like teardrops. Somewhat like the tears you cried after finally managing to reach the body...
		
		#LOC_OPX_IW_SCI_Doppler_Crew_SpaceH = It's really, really red... like Duna's polar opposite.
		#LOC_OPX_IW_SCI_Doppler_Crew_SpaceL = From this vantage point, the surface seems more like powder, like a really thick strawberry cookie.
		#LOC_OPX_IW_SCI_Doppler_Crew_C = The dust flew off as you landed. What is this on here?
		#LOC_OPX_IW_SCI_Doppler_Crew_M = Looks somewhat dusty here. Whatever's here must be really rubbly.
		#LOC_OPX_IW_SCI_Doppler_Crew_E = Too powdery here. Almost like snow... so how come it hasn't sublimated?
		
		#LOC_OPX_IW_SCI_Dyva_Crew_SpaceH = With Doppler in the background, you can't help but see this as an odd sort of moon.
		#LOC_OPX_IW_SCI_Dyva_Crew_SpaceL = You don't know how two asteroids could have come together at such a tiny speed, let alone come into orbit around another asteroid.
		#LOC_OPX_IW_SCI_Dyva_Crew_MaL = The ground buckles a bit under the ship... And then bounces back. Then buckles again.
		#LOC_OPX_IW_SCI_Dyva_Crew_MiL = The ground buckles a bit under the ship... And then bounces back. Then buckles again.
		#LOC_OPX_IW_SCI_Dyva_Crew_CoP = How you landed between these two lobes is a mystery for the ages.
		
		// EVA Report
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_SpaceH = Quazen is an incredibly strange beast. It looks like a bunch of random materials got clubbed together with a stick.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_SpaceL = Glints of light from the lake-like region. Is this water?
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_B = All you can see is just... blue. You then start humming some old song to yourself.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_M = You can jump off pretty high and see both of the lobes. The gravity must be really strong in the interlobe regions.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_S = The footsteps are starting to have some give. It's getting fluffy up here...
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_L = On Kerbin, these sapphires would have either been crushed underneath you or cut you up like a bunch of tiny knives. Here, it's kind of like a really bouncy gravel trail.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_G = You kick up some dust from the surface, but it does at least rain back down. You wipe some off your helmet.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_D = Here the dust is somewhat light; at neck depth, you'll hit bedrock.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_C = The towering cliffs from the crater are ridiculous vistas. You take a photo just for personal enjoyment.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_I = You can feel yourself getting heavier here. It must be a major achievement to be able to walk up to either of the lobes.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_NP = Yes, just like Festivus.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_EVA_SP = Like tears in rain.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_EVA_SpaceH = Doppler reminds you of Grandma's cookies. They were awful cookies.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_EVA_SpaceL = This asteroid feels like Duna, but wrong. So wrong.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_EVA_C = Your footsteps seem to be somewhat rigid on here. But a little kick of a loose rock gives it its second, more transient moon.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_EVA_M = It feels like a fragment of Duna, except if you jumped you would head straight into orbit.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_EVA_E = This is white. How white.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_EVA_SpaceH = Your mouth waters just looking at this.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_EVA_SpaceL = If space weren't a vacuum, you'd be tasting the surface right now.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_EVA_Landed = Your stomach feels strange. Is this because it looks like a cookie, or because you feel something right underneath you?
		
		// Mystery Goo
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Goo_Space = The goo is tearing in two.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Goo_Landed = The goo is whole again. Then it broke again. Then it's whole again...
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Goo_Space = The goo is redshifting.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Goo_Landed = The goo is blueshifting.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Goo_SpaceH = The goo is unresponsive.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Goo_SpaceL = The goo is acting prissy.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Goo_Landed = The goo is nervous now. It bobs up and down.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Goo_CoP = YOU'RE TEARING THE GOO APART, DYVA!
		
		// Mobile Materials Lab
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Lab_Space = The light reflecting off the gems seems similar to the glints in the lake. Whatever it is, it sure isn't water.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Lab_Landed = Not any different from another vacuum body. The samples are, however, sadly lost on the surface.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Lab_Space = These materials haven't changed much, though a couple of metal samples have oxidized due to miniature ice impacts.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Lab_Landed = Well well. Seems like tholins might be the material of the day.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Lab_Space = This is far from an intriguing destination.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Lab_Landed = With this "gravity," none of these materials are even going to impact Dyva except on geological timescales.
		
		// Temperature
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Temp_Space = The interlobes seem to be somewhat stressed compared to the outer regions. There may be geological activity at bay.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Temp_Landed = The surface is somewhat warmer than expected, suggesting at least some geological activity.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Temp_Space = Doppler is surprisingly cold for an asteroid of its size.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Temp_Landed = Yes, this is somewhat chilly. Gets a bit warmer at the equators... perhaps there's a bit of tidal action going on, however subtle there is.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Temp_Space = The usual reflection from an asteroid, with somewhat seasonal heating.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Temp_Landed = The asteroid is... anomalously warm. You don't know if this will stay true of the cold side.
		
		// Barometer
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Bar_Space = Whatever atmosphere this may have had would have been flung off by the sheer speed of its rotation.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Bar_Landed = Thin exosphere caused by cosmic ray reactions, but too little to even consider.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Bar = A bit of outgassing here, but nothing else.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Bar_Space = Observe, the atmosphere of a butter cookie.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Bar_Landed = There's a teeny, tiny hint of an atmosphere./n/n/And then it disappears...
		
		// Gravity
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Grav_Space = Quazen's got some pretty high gravity for its size, but based on its incredible spin speed it might not have that much gravity in the lobes.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Grav_Landed = There's a strong pull toward the interlobe region, but the lobes themselves are pretty low-gravity.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Grav_I = Welp. This sure is a dense region.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Grav_Space = The craft may be messing with Dyva's orbit somewhat...
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Grav_Landed = By landing here, you may have accidentally set this asteroid on a future collision course. Shame on you.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Grav_Space = This is where gravity goes to die.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Grav_Landed = You didn't even know something could land on an object this tiny.
		
		// Seismic
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Seis_Landed = Something's churning somewhat inside, but it might just be because of the rotation.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Seis_I = There's nothing here. The activity must be in the lobes.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Seis_NP = There's nothing here. The activity must be in the lobes.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Seis_SP = There's nothing here. The activity must be in the lobes.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Seis = Teeny tiny bit of venting and tidal action, but otherwise not really much to write home about.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Seis_MaL = The spacecraft buckles ever so slightly once about every minute.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Seis_MiL = The spacecraft buckles ever so slightly once about every minute.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Seis_CoP = There's an ever-so-slight buckle here... but it's quite quick.
		
		// Magnetic
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Mag_Space = There does seem to be a magnetic field here, however subtle.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Quazen_Mag_Landed = This magnetism is sure unexpected for an asteroid of its size... how does this happen?
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Doppler_Mag = Observe, the magnetism of a top.
		
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Mag_Space = Magnetic analysis reveals an anomalously high content of iron, depsite relatively low density.
		#LOC_OPX-IW_SCI_Dyva_Mag_Landed = This iron seems to be moving around, but there's no true magnetic field to be seen.
